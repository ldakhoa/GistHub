# Privacy Policy

## Personal user information

GistHub requires a basic GitHub OAuth authentication.
GistHub requests access to the user's profile, email and public notifications.

## Personal Access Token (PAT)

You have the option to add a PAT to have your own access. The token created will be stored locally and will never be sent to GistHub or any server other than GitHub.

## Security & Limited Liability

GistHub follows good practices of security, but 100% security can't be granted in software. GistHub is provided as it without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

Client-side communication is encrypted using HTTPs. Server-side tokens are encrypted or behind environment variables. We recommend being extra careful with which browser extension you have installed to avoid token exposure to third parties
