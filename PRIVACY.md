# Privacy Policy

## Personal user information

GistHub requires a basic GitHub OAuth authentication.
GistHub requests access to the user's profile, email, and public notifications.

## Personal Access Token (PAT)

You have the option to add a PAT to have your own access. The token created will be stored locally and will never be sent to GistHub or any server other than GitHub.

## Security & Limited Liability

GistHub follows good practices of security, but 100% security can't be granted in software. GistHub is provided as it without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

Client-side communication is encrypted using HTTPs. Server-side tokens are encrypted or behind environment variables. We recommend being extra careful with which browser extension you have installed to avoid token exposure to third parties

## Image security

When using GistHub to upload images to Imgur, we take several measures to protect your privacy. Specifically, we:
- Use secure transmission protocols (such as HTTPS) to encrypt communication between the application and Imgur's servers during the upload process.
- Do not modify or alter the original image content during the upload process, unless explicitly authorized by the user.
- Do not store any images locally on the device after they have been successfully uploaded to Imgur.
- Store uploaded images anonymously on Imgur's servers, without being associated with any specific Imgur account. Please note that these images may be subject to Imgur's privacy policy and terms of service.
